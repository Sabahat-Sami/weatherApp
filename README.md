# Weather App that pulls data from openweathermap API

The project uses the axios library to get data from the openweathermap site. The data is displayed using React JS, utilizing a search bar component to enter a city name, a dropdown that allows the user to select the state, and a button component that triggers a get request on click. Tailwind CSS was used for basic styling and animations.
